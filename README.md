# Inate theme for Hugo

A Hugo theme combining Hugo themes [Introduction](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-introduction) designed by [Victoria Drake](https://victoria.dev) and [Slate](https://github.com/gesquive/slate) designed by [Gus Esquivel](https://github.com/gesquive). Thanks to both designers for sharing and openly licensing their work. 

This site generates a minimalist single-page combining Introduction's multilingual structure, responsiveness, and presentation of longer text with Slate's 'speed dial' structure for dynamically shuffled tiles linking out as a kind of index. 

New to the Hugo static site generator? [Learn the fundamentals here](https://gohugo.io/categories/fundamentals).

## Getting started

Requires the **extended** version of Hugo. You can find [installation instructions here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) (latest version recommended). Here's a handy [Bash function for downloading a specific Hugo version](https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-do-twice-as-much-with-half-the-keystrokes-using-.bashrc/#bash-function-for-downloading-extended-hugo).

## Get the theme

Run from the root of your Hugo site:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/COPIM/inate-hugo.git themes/inate
```

Alternatively, you can include this repository as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitsubmodules). This makes it easier to update this theme if you have your Hugo site in git as well:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/COPIM/inate-hugo.git themes/inate
```
